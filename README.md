A version of the classic Snake arcade game that I built to teach myself Rust and the Bevy game engine.

Collect the coins to rack up your score, and avoid crashing into walls or even your own tail! Be careful though, as you collect more coins, your snake will grow increasing the risk of collision!

Control the snake's direction with the arrow keys, on a Game Over you can use the Space key to restart the game.

You can play the game on [Itch.io](https://jackaloupe.itch.io/bevy-snake)!
